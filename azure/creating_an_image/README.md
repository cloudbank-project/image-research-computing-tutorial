# Creating a VM image on the Azure cloud

This procedural walks you through creating a working Virtual Machine with a Jupyter notebook server, testing it, 
and storing it as an Azure machine image. This last step is a single click task; the bulk of the effort is 
the preparation. This walk-through uses the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com), a browser-based interface to
the services available on the Azure cloud. 


## Walk-through

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com) and find or create a *Resource Group* in a region nearest to you.
* Within this Resource Group click on +Add and select Marketplace. This is where we find existing "blank" images.
